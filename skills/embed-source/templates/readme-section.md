## Embedded library source

`repos/` holds a full copy of some dependencies' source, so coding agents can read the real implementation and tests instead of guessing from docs. `docs/idioms/` holds short notes that quote the idioms this project uses, with a path into `repos/` above each snippet. `CLAUDE.md` tells agents to start there.

| lib | version | fetched from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| {lib} | {version} | {repo} at tag `{ref}` |

Rules:

- Never import from `repos/`. Import from the installed package.
- Never edit files under `repos/`. They are replaced wholesale on the next fetch.
- Lint, type-check, and tests skip `repos/`.

`repos/` is not in git. `pnpm install` runs `scripts/sync-repos.sh`, which reads the table in `repos/README.md` and does a shallow clone of each pinned tag. Run the script by hand if the folder is missing. Set `EMBED_SOURCE_SKIP=1` to skip the fetch.

After bumping a package, change its tag in `repos/README.md`, run `scripts/sync-repos.sh`, and change the version in this table, in the `CLAUDE.md` table, and in the first line of each `docs/idioms/{lib}-*.md` file.
